Things You Should Know:

1) I'm starting a pretty rigorous workout routine, and it comes with a diet plan. If it's not too much to ask, I'd love for my foods to be based on this plan: https://www.muscleandfitness.com/muscle-fitness-hers/hers-nutrition/8-week-abs-diet-plan/. I know this is a lot to ask, but I really hope you can make these accommodations for me. Thanks so much.

2) As I'm pretty much making sure that my life, until summer, will be dedicated completely to working out, rather than purchasing 70,000 different machines, I was thinking about finally getting a gym membership. I will fund it all myself so you guys don't have to pay for it (It's $15/mo). Also, I will be going to the gym every single day, no matter the conditions, from 7-8:30 Every single day (More than enough to complete a set for my plan). I will then come home, do school, and then work out with Simon after school.
